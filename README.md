# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A simple desktop application built using Python and Tkinter to visualize and analyze classic CPU scheduling algorithms.

## Features

- Add processes with:
  - Process ID
  - Arrival Time
  - Burst Time
  - Priority
- Simulate multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin
- View simulation results:
  - Waiting times
  - Turnaround times
  - Average waiting and turnaround times

## How It Works

- Enter details for each process.
- Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown.
- For Round Robin, enter the Time Quantum.
- Click **Simulate** to see:
  - A summary table of process stats.
  - Average waiting and turnaround times.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Tkinter for the GUI

## Usage

1. Install Python on your machine.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python your_script_name.py
   ```
3. Use the interface to input processes and run simulations.
