# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator
A CPU Scheduling Simulator built to visualize and analyze classic CPU scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin. Users can input process details and observe how different algorithms schedule processes, calculate waiting times, turnaround times, and improve CPU utilization.
